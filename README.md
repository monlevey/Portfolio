# Accessiblity Semantic Project
## Description
The project aims to improve accessiblity of the Horiseon website, whilst mirroring the original mock up. The code has been re-structured into conventional semantic HTML and the CSS stylesheet has been condensed to mirror that.  

Code was refactored to better learn semantic HTML and how to condense CSS.

## Usage
This website's codebase meets accessibility standards, using Semantic HTML elements. Images are optimized for screen readers and have alt tags. Links will open in separate browser tabs. Some parts of the website are linked to unfinished projects, they will however, be completed by the end of the year.
