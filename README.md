# Mon Levey Portfolio

## Description
The project aims to provide the user with information about Monique Levey. It involved linking previous projects, contact information and images to the website. The website needed to be accessible and responsive. 

Code was created to better learn semantic HTML and use advanced CSS.

## Usage
This website's codebase meets accessibility standards, using Semantic HTML elements. Images are optimized for screen readers and have alt tags. Links will open in separate browser tabs. Some parts of the website are linked to unfinished projects, they will however, be completed by the end of the year.
